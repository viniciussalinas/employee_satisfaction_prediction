### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is part of a project developed by Group 11, consisting of Emanuel Luz de Abreu, Leidiana de Carli, Lissandra Dutra, and Vin√≠cius Silva Salinas. The project focuses on analyzing HR employee data to predict employee satisfaction levels. Understanding and predicting employee satisfaction is vital for organizations to manage and reduce turnover rates, control costs, and ensure workforce satisfaction.

### Business Understanding
Employee turnover, characterized by the flow of people entering and leaving an organization, has a profound impact on various organizational metrics, such as employee satisfaction, recruitment and training costs, and customer satisfaction. This project aims to predict employee satisfaction levels based on attributes such as the number of projects, average monthly working hours, years since the last evaluation, and more. By predicting employee satisfaction, organizations can take proactive measures to improve retention and employee well-being.

### Data Understanding
The project utilizes the "HR Employee Analytics" dataset obtained from Kaggle, provided by the user Kamal Das. This dataset contains HR data from the MNC company. The dataset is composed of a single Excel file containing 14,599 records and 11 columns. The columns include attributes like Emp_Id, satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, number_project, average_monthly_hours, time_spend_company, work_accident, left, promotion_last_5years, Department, and salary.

### Data Preparation
The data preparation phase involves cleaning the dataset, standardizing column names, and encoding categorical variables. The salary column is treated as an ordinal variable and the department column as a nominal variable using One-Hot Encoding and Ordinal Encoding techniques, respectively. Data quality checks are performed to identify missing values and outliers.

### Modeling
In the modeling phase, a regression model is created to predict employee satisfaction levels. The target variable is satisfaction_level, and the predictor variables are the other attributes from the dataset. A Random Forest Regressor model is used for the prediction.

### Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results indicate how well the model predicts employee satisfaction levels based on the input data.

### Final Conclusion
The project aims to assist decision-makers in developing human resources (HR) policies to increase employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and manage workforce planning. The analyses generated by this algorithm provide insights for HR departments and help in planning recruitment and continuous professional development for employees. The data-driven approach enables organizations to improve employee satisfaction, ultimately leading to more satisfied employees and better business outcomes.
